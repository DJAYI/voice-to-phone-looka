## 1. What is IP Telephony?

IP telephony is a communication system that enables making and receiving telephone calls over the internet. Unlike conventional telephony that uses copper cables (PSTN), this technology converts voice into digital data packets that travel efficiently across the network.

It forms the foundation of **unified communications**, integrating voice, video and messaging on a single platform.

## 2. How does VoIP technology work?

The technical operation can be summarized in three critical steps:

1. **Digitization:** The analog voice signal is converted into digital data packets.
2. **Transmission:** These packets are sent over the IP network (Internet) using specific protocols.
3. **Reconversion:** Upon arrival at the destination, the data is converted back into audio for the recipient.

To deploy VoIP you only need a **stable internet connection** and compatible devices such as IP phones, ATA adapters or software applications (**softphones**).
