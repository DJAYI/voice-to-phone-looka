      <span class="text-accent text-lg font-semibold mb-2 block">Core Action: Calculate First, Then Execute</span>
      
      We don't start from "feeling," but from the "end point." Using our unique financial model, we work with you to accurately forecast the new year's three core targets: income, costs, and cash flow. Together, we create a clear, visible, and actionable annual profit blueprint.

      <span class="text-accent text-lg font-semibold mb-2 block">Core Action: Everyone Shares the Load</span>
      
      Even the best blueprint needs a strong construction team. We teach you how to scientifically break down the company-level profit blueprint into specific KPIs for each department and position. This ensures that from top to bottom, everyone has clear targets, every task has ownership, and all efforts are focused on the same profit goal.

  - title: "Step 3: [System Incentives] Link Compensation & Rewards"
    description: |
      <span class="text-accent text-lg font-semibold mb-2 block">Core Action: Pay for Results</span>
      
      Building a self-motivated "profit-generating" team comes down to the "art of profit sharing." We help you design a transparent, fair, and highly motivating compensation and reward system that strongly links individual and team income to KPI completion. Employees no longer work for the boss—they fight for their own wallets.

  - title: "Step 4: [Continuous Optimization] Review & Adjust"
    description: |
      <span class="text-accent text-lg font-semibold mb-2 block">Core Action: Continuous Iteration</span>
      
      Markets change, and plans must change with them. We provide a simple and efficient review mechanism (daily reports, weekly meetings, monthly analysis) to help you and your team continuously track results, identify issues, and quickly adjust actions. This ensures your profit blueprint remains dynamic, forming a virtuous cycle of continuous growth and self-optimization.
